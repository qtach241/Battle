// This file contains the base element for all custom data driven ability key values.
// All custom data driven abilities are defined in the abilities/<ability_name> folder.
// The #base directive is used to append each ability structure to the "DOTAABilities"
// base structure.
//
// To add a new custom data driven ability, create a file in the abilities folder.
// Follow the naming convention (hero name and ability name separated by underscores as
// appropriate). Then append the ability structure to this file using the #base directive.
