// Description:
// The Assault variant of the reload ability. Unlike other hero's reload abilities
// (i.e. Sniper and Heavy), the Shotgun is reloaded one single shell at a time.
// Each individual shell is its own channelled ability. Casting the ability will
// attempt to reload the Shotgun to full capacity, one shell at a time. Moving 
// anytime will cancel the the reload if it has not reached full capacity yet.
