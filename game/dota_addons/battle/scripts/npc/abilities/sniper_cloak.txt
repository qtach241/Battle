// Description:
// Sniper's 3rd ability. Sniper cloaks himself turning invisible for a time, but moves slower.
// Using Sniper's first skill snipe before the duration is up grant bonus damage to the bullet
// and end the cloak buff immediately. This skill is very much like the item Shadow Blade, with
// a movement speed decrease instead of a bonus.
