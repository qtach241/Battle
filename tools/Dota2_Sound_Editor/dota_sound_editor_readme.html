<h1>Requirements</h1>
Java version 7. Java can be found at <a href="http://www.java.com/getjava"/‎>www.java.com/getjava</a>.

<h1>How to use</h1>
<h2><a name="setting">Setting up</a></h2>
1. Open Steam and click on Library.<br>
2. Right click on Dota 2, and select Properties.<br>
3. Select <i>Set Launch Options</i>.<br>
4. Add <i>-override_vpk</i> to the launch options.<br>

<h2>Running the program</h2>
Simply open Dota_Sound_Editor.jar!

<h2>Using Dota 2 Sound Editor</h2>
The Dota 2 Sound Editor allows you to modify sounds for items, voices, music and hero spells.
To begin, select a tab from the top of the window. Then, if applicable, select an entry from the dropdown box and 
expand the list of sounds associated with a particular action. From there, you can view each sound for a hero spell,
item, musical trigger or voiceover. For each sound, you can:<br><br>

<b>Replace</b><br>
This allows you to change what sound plays when the selected action is triggered.<br><br>

<b>Revert</b><br>
This restores the selected action to its default sound.<br><br>

<b>Revert All</b><br>
<ul>
<li><b>Hero Spells:</b> This restores all actions for to current hero to their default sounds.</li>
<li><b>Items:</b>  This restores all item actions to their default sound.</li></b>
<li><b>Music:</b> This restores all music for the current category to its default song.</li>
<li><b>Voice:</b> This restores all voices for the current unit/announcer to their default sounds.
</ul>
<br>
<b>Advanced/Basic</b><br>
The Advanced button allows you to view the current selection's entire sound script as a tree. Currently, manual editing is 
not supported, but will be added in the future.<br>
While in Advanced mode, Replace, Revert and Play Sound will only work on nodes that contain a path to a sound file.<br>
Clicking the <b>Basic</b> button will return the editor to Basic mode.

<h1>Distribution</h1>
Dota 2 Sound Editor is free to use, and may be freely redistributed.

<h1>Troubleshooting</h1>
<h2>I can't launch the sound editor!</h2>
<li>Check to make sure that the <i>Dota_Sound_Editor.jar</i> is in the same folder as the <i>lib</i> folder.</li>
<li>Ensure that your Java<a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/installed.jsp?detect=jre&try=1"/‎> is up to date</a>.</li>
<br>

<h2>My custom sounds aren't playing in game!</h2>
<li>Make sure you have -override_vpk set, as described in <a href="#setting">Setting Up</a>.</li>
<li>If you are replacing an item sound, ensure that it is the same file type (WAV or MP3) as the original,
and that it matches the original's bitrate (1141 kbps for WAVs, 128 kbps for MP3s) and frequency (44.1KHz).</li>
<li>Check that your sound file is a .WAV or .MP3 file. If it is, try re-encoding it at a lower 
frequency or bitrate--it's possible that Dota 2 only supports sound files in certain encodings.</li>
<li>Check that your sound was copied successfully. The program copies custom sounds to
<YOUR STEAM LOCATION>/Steam/steamapps/common/dota 2 beta/dota/sound/custom.</li>
<li>Check that the script file was modified appropriately. For example, if you changed Abaddon's 
Death sound to <i>wilhelm.wav</i>, you would navigate to 
<YOUR STEAM LOCATION>/Steam/steamapps/common/dota 2 beta/dota/scripts/game_sounds_heroes/ and open
game_sounds_abaddon.txt. Under the Hero_Abbadon.Death section, you would check to see if the <i>wave</i>
section was pointed to <i>custom/abaddon/wilhelm.wav</i>.</li>
<li>If all else fails, the nuclear solution that <i>might</i> work is to delete your sound.cache
from <YOUR STEAM LOCATION>/Steam/steamapps/common/dota 2 beta/dota/sound, and then Verify the Integrity 
of your Game Cache. To do this, open Steam -> right-click Dota 2 -> select
Properties -> select the Local Files tab -> Click <i>Verify Integrity of Game Cache</i>, and wait for it to complete.
Afterward, try replacing the game sounds again.</li>
<br>

<h2>My custom item sounds are being cut off!</h2>
This seems to be a limitation of item sound modding. Custom item sounds must be the same length as, 
or shorter than, the sounds they are replacing. Sorry!

<h2>Some of my regular game sounds aren't playing!</h2>
Try verifying Dota's game cache. To do this, open Steam -> right-click Dota 2 -> select
Properties -> select the Local Files tab -> Click <i>Verify Integrity of Game Cache</i>, and wait for it to complete.
<br><br>
Alternately, this can happen if Valve adds a new sound for an existing action. To fix this, just open the sound 
editor, and select the Hero/Item/Music from the dropdown box. When the program loads those sounds, it
will automatically update with any new sounds Valve has added.
<br>
 
<h2>Wait, why does that happen?</h2>
The sound editor copies the script files that describe what sounds to play from the internal game files.
It then uses those copied script files to hold all your modifications, and to tell the game which sounds to play.
Unfortunately, if Valve updates these script files, your modified files won't have those changes, so the 
editor has to get a fresh, updated version from the internal game files. Until it does so, any new 
actions won't know what sound to play.
 
<h1>Found a bug?</h1>
Please let me know. When the program crashes, it attempts to generate an error.txt. Attaching these 
files to an email, and giving a detailed description of what you were doing when the program crashed 
both help a lot in determining the cause of a bug or crash. Thanks!
